\section{Introduction}
In the mean-field picture, nucleons inside nuclei move in single-particle orbitals with well-defined energies and quantum numbers. This approach, yet it describes many of the nuclear properties, fails to account for short-range correlations among nucleons. 

Transfer reactions, in which a single nucleon is added or removed from a core, provide a unique tool to probe the impact of those correlations in the single-particle strengths. For that regard, spectroscopic factors (SF) consitute a measure of the shell occupancies and thus they measure directly the magnitude of the SRC.
